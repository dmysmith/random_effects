# The alphabet soup project:
# Partitioning variance into genetic, environmental, and subject-specific components
This set of projects uses FEMA (https://github.com/cmig-research-group/cmig_tools/) to apply mixed-effects models to the ABCD dataset (https://abcdstudy.org/).
The main goal is to estimate heritability of various behavioral and imaging measures.
